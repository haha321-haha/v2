    "answer": "Non-medical methods include: heat therapy (hot water bottle, warm patch), light exercise (such as yoga, walking), dietary adjustments (increasing intake of magnesium, calcium, vitamin B1), acupressure (Sanyinjiao, Hegu points), etc. For mild to moderate period pain, these methods may provide effective relief."

But if it is secondary period pain (caused by diseases such as endometriosis, uterine fibroids, etc.), the related diseases may need treatment. If you have fertility concerns, it is recommended to consult a specialist for detailed examination."
