# Medication vs Natural Remedies: Which Menstrual Pain Relief Method Is Right for You?

## Introduction

Facing menstrual pain challenges, modern women have unprecedented treatment options: from traditional medication to increasingly popular natural remedies. But how do you find the most suitable solution among numerous choices? This article, based on the latest medical research and clinical evidence, provides comprehensive comparative analysis and personalized selection guidance.

> 💡 **Basic Preparation**: Before choosing treatment options, we recommend first understanding the basic medication knowledge in our [Complete Safe Medication Guide for Dysmenorrhea](/en/downloads/medication-guide), as well as the practical carrying tips in our [Complete Guide to Emergency Menstrual Pain Medication](/en/articles/menstrual-pain-emergency-medication-guide).

## Part I: Complete Analysis of Medication Treatment

### 1.1 Nonsteroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAIDs)

**Representative Medications**:
- **Ibuprofen**: 400-600mg, every 6-8 hours
- **Naproxen**: 220-440mg, every 8-12 hours
- **Diclofenac**: 50mg, every 8 hours

**Mechanism of Action**:
NSAIDs work by inhibiting cyclooxygenase (COX) activity, reducing prostaglandin synthesis, thereby relieving pain caused by uterine contractions. According to Cochrane systematic reviews, NSAIDs have an 80-85% effectiveness rate for primary dysmenorrhea.

> 📋 **Detailed Guidance**: For specific usage methods, dosage calculations, and safety precautions for ibuprofen, naproxen, and other NSAIDs, please refer to the professional comparison tables in our [Complete Safe Medication Guide for Dysmenorrhea](/en/downloads/medication-guide).
