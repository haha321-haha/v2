# Complete Guide to Emergency Menstrual Pain Medication: Professional Solutions for Pain Relief Anywhere, Anytime

## Introduction

Menstrual pain is a common issue many women face during their periods, sometimes severely affecting daily life and work. To help you quickly relieve pain at critical moments, this guide will detail over-the-counter medication options, carrying compliance guidelines, emergency medication decision processes, and safe usage precautions. Whether you're at school, workplace, or traveling, this guide will help you prepare adequately.

> 💡 **Basic Preparation**: If you're new to menstrual pain medication, we recommend first reading our [Complete Safe Medication Guide for Dysmenorrhea](/en/downloads/medication-guide) to understand basic medication knowledge and safety precautions.

## 1. Over-the-Counter Medication Selection Guide

### 1.1 Ibuprofen-Based Medications

**Mechanism of Action**:
Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that reduces pain and inflammation by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis. According to Mayo Clinic research, ibuprofen is effective for 92% of menstrual pain patients.

> 📚 **Learn More**: For detailed usage methods, dosage comparisons, and safety guidelines for ibuprofen, please refer to the professional comparison tables in our [Complete Safe Medication Guide for Dysmenorrhea](/en/downloads/medication-guide).

**Suitable Population**:
- Moderate to severe menstrual pain
- Pain accompanied by inflammation (such as endometriosis-related pain)

**Recommended Dosage**:
- Adults: 200-400mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 1200mg daily (follow package instructions)
- Adolescents (12+ years): Calculate by weight, typically 5-10mg/kg every 6-8 hours

**Precautions**:
- Avoid taking on empty stomach to reduce gastric discomfort
- Contraindications: Use cautiously in patients with gastric ulcers, kidney dysfunction, or asthma

**Common Brands**:
- Motrin
- Advil

### 1.2 Acetaminophen-Based Medications

**Mechanism of Action**:
Acetaminophen (such as Tylenol) primarily relieves menstrual pain by inhibiting pain signals in the central nervous system but lacks anti-inflammatory properties.

**Suitable Population**:
- Mild to moderate menstrual pain
- Those allergic to NSAIDs

**Recommended Dosage**:
- Adults: 500-1000mg every 4-6 hours, not exceeding 4000mg daily
- Adolescents: Calculate by weight, typically 10-15mg/kg every 4-6 hours

**Precautions**:
- Overdose may cause liver damage; avoid concurrent alcohol consumption
- Not suitable for long-term use

**Common Brands**:
- Tylenol
- Panadol

### 1.3 Naproxen-Based Medications

**Mechanism of Action**:
Naproxen is another NSAID with longer duration than ibuprofen, typically lasting 8-12 hours.

**Suitable Population**:
- Patients needing long-lasting menstrual pain relief
- Those with severe nighttime menstrual pain

**Recommended Dosage**:
- Adults: 220mg every 8-12 hours, not exceeding 660mg daily
- Adolescents: Use under medical guidance

**Precautions**:
- Similar contraindications to ibuprofen
- Slower onset but longer duration

**Common Brands**:
- Aleve

### 1.4 Combination Preparations

**Common Combinations**:
- Acetaminophen + Caffeine
- Ibuprofen + Caffeine

**Advantages**:
- Caffeine can enhance analgesic effects
- Suitable for menstrual pain patients with fatigue

**Precautions**:
