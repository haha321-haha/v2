## User Testimonials

> "I used to eat randomly during my period, only realizing I should eat well when the pain hit. Now I prepare warm, comforting foods for myself and feel much better."

> "I didn't expect eating the right foods would actually help. My stomach doesn't feel as bloated, and my energy is better too."

## Recipe Principles: Natural, Balanced, Gentle

### 🌱 Choose Natural Ingredients
Prioritize fresh vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and quality proteins (fish, chicken, legumes).

### ⚖️ Balance Nutrients
Focus on supplementing iron (prevent anemia), magnesium (relieve cramps), B vitamins (stabilize mood), and Omega-3 fatty acids (anti-inflammatory).

### 🔥 Gentle Cooking Methods
Steaming, boiling, and stewing are easier to digest. Avoid frying and grilling.

### ⚠️ Avoid Irritating Foods
Limit spicy, cold, high-sugar, high-salt foods, caffeine, and alcohol. Traditional medicine believes cold foods can cause stagnation and worsen period pain.
