# Comprehensive Menstrual Sleep Quality Improvement Guide: Evidence-Based Medical Methods

*Based on the latest research from the American Academy of Sleep Medicine (AASM), American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and NIH*

Over 60% of women experience decreased sleep quality during menstruation, including difficulty falling asleep, frequent awakenings, and daytime fatigue. This guide provides a scientific 21-day sleep improvement plan to help establish long-term quality sleep patterns.

## I. Comprehensive Identification of Menstrual Sleep Problems

### 1.1 Common Sleep Disorder Types

**Primary Sleep Issues**
- **Difficulty falling asleep**: Taking more than 30 minutes to fall asleep before and during menstruation
- **Sleep interruption**: Frequent nighttime awakenings with difficulty returning to sleep
- **Early awakening**: Waking 1-2 hours earlier than usual
- **Daytime fatigue**: Feeling tired despite adequate sleep duration

**Root Cause Analysis**
- **Hormonal fluctuations**: Changes in estrogen and progesterone levels affect sleep regulation
- **Pain interference**: Menstrual cramps, bloating, and other physical discomfort affect sleep quality
- **Emotional changes**: Anxiety and depression from premenstrual syndrome

### 1.2 Quick Sleep Quality Self-Assessment

**Simplified PSQI Assessment** (0-3 points each):
- Does it take more than 30 minutes to fall asleep?
- Do you wake up ≥2 times per night?
- Do you sleep <7 hours?
- Do you still feel tired upon waking?

**Score Interpretation**:
- 0-3 points: Good sleep quality
- 4-6 points: Fair sleep quality, needs improvement
- 7-12 points: Poor sleep quality, professional help recommended

### 1.3 Scientific Impact of Menstrual Cycle on Sleep

| Cycle Phase | Hormonal Characteristics | Sleep Performance | Focus Areas |
|-------------|-------------------------|-------------------|-------------|
| **Menstrual Phase** (1-5 days) | Lowest hormone levels | Pain affects sleep | Pain management |
| **Follicular Phase** (6-14 days) | Gradually rising estrogen | Better sleep quality | Maintain good habits |
| **Ovulation Phase** (14-16 days) | Hormonal fluctuations | Possible mild insomnia | Stress management |
| **Luteal Phase** (17-28 days) | Rising then falling progesterone | Fragmented sleep | Environment optimization |

## II. Systematic Sleep Environment Optimization

### 2.1 Scientific Bedroom Environment Design

**Temperature and Humidity**
- **Optimal temperature**: 18-20℃ (can be raised 1-2 degrees during menstruation)
- **Humidity control**: 40-60%, use humidifier or dehumidifier as needed
- **Air circulation**: Maintain moderate ventilation, avoid direct drafts

**Light Management**
- **Pre-sleep preparation**: Use warm light (<2700K) 1 hour before bed
- **Complete darkness**: Use blackout curtains, eye masks as supplement
- **Morning light exposure**: Get natural light within 30 minutes of waking

**Noise Control**
- **Ideal environment**: Below 30 decibels
- **White noise**: Use white noise machines or phone apps to mask disturbances
- **Sound insulation**: Use comfortable noise-reducing earplugs when necessary

### 2.2 Sleep Product Selection Guide
