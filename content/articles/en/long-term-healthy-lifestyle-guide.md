## Introduction: Why Do You Need a Long-term Healthy Lifestyle?

Menstrual health is not just about managing a few days each month, but a systematic project that requires long-term planning and continuous maintenance. By establishing scientific and sustainable healthy lifestyle habits, we can fundamentally improve menstrual health, reduce the frequency and severity of menstrual pain, and enhance overall quality of life.

Avoid seeking quick results, gradually establishing and consolidating healthy habits through small, consistent steps.
